# UML

**Table of contents:**
- [Running in test mode](#running-in-test-mode)
- [Running in profiler mode](#running-in-profiler-mode)
- [Checking code style, PEP8 compliance & dead code](#checking-code-style-pep8-compliance--dead-code)

Some [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) file have been created to help understand and begin to work on the project.
These files were written using the [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) syntax. This syntax has the advantage of being in text format. This makes it easier to use on git (unlike the binary format).

Each UML Schema is store in two format: picture (in `PNG`) and source code (in `TXT`).


## Class dependencies

To correctly understand the project, it is important to understand the different link between classes.
